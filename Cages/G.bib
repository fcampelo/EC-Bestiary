  abstract="In this paper, a new class of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) named as Genetic Folding (GF) is introduced. GF is based on novel chromosomes organisation which is structured in a parent form. In this paper, the model selection problem of Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernel expression has been utilised as a case study. Five UCI datasets have been tested and experimental results are compared with other methods. As a conclusion, the proposed algorithm is very promising and it can be applied to solve further complicated domains and problems.",
