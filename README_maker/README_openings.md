We do not endorse or recommend the use of any of the methods listed
here. In fact, we find most if not all of them quite ridiculous, and in
many cases a useless waste of space. ***If you send us a message asking
to have your own recently-published paper included here, you are
publicly acknowledging that you have absolutely no idea what you're
doing with your academic life, and that you're too distracted to even
realise that we're making fun of you***. You have been warned.

Before we continue, here's a list of papers anyone working (or thinking
about working) with metaphor-based metaheuristics should read first:

## Introduction

The field of meta-heuristic search algorithms has a long history of
finding inspiration in natural systems. Starting from classics such as
Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colony Optimization, the last two decades
have witnessed an explosion of natural (and sometimes supernatural)
heuristics - from Birds and Bees to Zombies and Reincarnation.

The goal of the Evolutionary Computation Bestiary is to catalog the,
ermm... exuberance of the meta-heuristic "eco-system". We try to keep a
list of the many different animals, plants, microbes, natural phenomena
and supernatural activities that can be spotted in the wild lands of the
metaphor-based computation literature.

While we personally believe that the literature could do with more
mathematics and less marsupials, and that we, as a community, should
grow past this metaphor-rich phase in our field's history (a bit like
chemistry outgrew alchemy), please note that this list makes no claims
about the scientific quality of the papers listed. The EC Bestiary puts
classic and well-validated works of the metaheuristics literature (e.g.,
GAs, ACO) and some that describe their methods in mostly metaphor-free
language (e.g., JTF, CFO) side by side with others for which the
scientific rigor is, to put it mildly, lacking. In short, **it is not a
Hall of Fame of algorithms** - think of it more as [The island of Doctor
Moreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau): a
place with a few good creatures, but which are vastly outnumbered by
mindless beasts.

Finally, if you know a metaphor-based method that is not listed here, or
if you know of an earlier mention of a listed method, please see the
bottom of the page on how to contribute!
